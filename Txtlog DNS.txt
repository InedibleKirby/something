Decide a domain name we want to use

set inside of config file

create another forward and reverse lookup zone.

you cannot just modify master.example

have this done by next monday.


is this live
its like slac for code writing

Any chance you could copy paste a script you write Monday here so I can take a look at what y'all did?


Write a script to create to create a file with a specified file size in to a specific directory?
 
Write a script the will scan a IP address using nmap to see it the host is up.
 
Write a script to accept variable, perform a task, then provide a formatted output.
scripts to come
!bin/bash


#this is an attempt to do my fist if else statment as well.



#prompt user to scan whole network or a specific ip

echo "Please input an Ip address to test to see if they are up"
echo "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/X"

read ipadd

nmap $ipadd -A  >> ~/nmap_scans

tail ~/nmap_scans




#!bin/bash


#prompt user for what size of file

echo "This script is to create a file of a specified size!!!"
echo "1st, lets decide how big you want the file to be, first select size, then unit."
read fisize

#prompt for KB, MB, GB
echo "Would you like your file size to be in KB, MB, or GB?"
read suffix


#prompt user for size of file
echo "Ok, your file will be $fisize $suffix in size!"

#promp user for finame
echo "Now, your file will be stored in the path, filname you input (ex. ~/etc/targetdirectory/targetfilename) "
read finame



#create file of specified size in specified path

echo "creating a file of random gyberish in" $finame "of size" $fisize" bytes"


dd if=/dev/zero of=$finame bs=$fisize$suffix count=1

#prove file was created.

ls -lh $path
